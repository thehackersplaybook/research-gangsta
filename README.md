Research Gangsta was started at The Hackers Playbook to promote a more real-world, actionable and simple framework to help people of all backgrounds understand technical papers better and implement the learnings in their day to day life.

It is inspired by the "Original Gangster" framework where all humans are treated with love and respect, and the principles for living are accounted by one's virtous intentions, thought, speech and action in the world not by wordly definitions of "right" and "wrong".

> Here, we don't refer to Gangster as criminal activity, but virtuous and truthful living, having a code of your own, not dictated by external authority but your own understanding of truth.

> Moreover, if you're a Gangster why not use this system to read a paper so you're adept to handling the next "scene" with sharper tactics, love and skillfulness? Imagine an OP using psychological manipulation tactics on your homies, and now because you read the right paper, you can disarm the OP before they can even plan! Don't take my word for it, see it work.

You get what you deserve. Rather, what you truly own, finds your way back to you, and what you don't truly own is taken away rightfully.
